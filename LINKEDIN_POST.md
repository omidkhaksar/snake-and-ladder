## 🎲 Excited to Share: 3D Snake & Ladder Game with AI! 

I'm thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project - a fully-featured 3D Snake & Ladder game built entirely with **Three.js** and modern web technologies! 🚀

### 🌟 What Makes It Special?

🤖 **AI Opponent** - Challenge an intelligent computer player that thinks and rolls automatically

🎨 **Egyptian Theme** - Stunning Egyptian-inspired design with gold, turquoise, and burgundy aesthetics

🎵 **Immersive Audio** - Background music and contextual sound effects for every game action

💾 **Smart Save System** - Auto-saves your progress and lets you resume exactly where you left off

👥 **Multiplayer Ready** - Supports 2-7 players with intelligent spacing and positioning

### 🛠️ Technical Highlights:

✅ **Three.js** for full 3D rendering with custom GLB models
✅ **Modular Architecture** - 8 separate classes for clean, maintainable code
✅ **Smart Game Logic** - Rotation-aware player movement, dynamic positioning
✅ **LocalStorage Persistence** - Seamless save/load functionality
✅ **Web Audio API** - Complete audio management system
✅ **Modern CSS** - Glassmorphism effects and responsive design
✅ **Vite** for lightning-fast development and optimized builds

### 📊 Project Stats:

- **6,900+ lines of code**
- **32 files** across modular architecture
- **8 core classes** (Game3D, Player, Snake, Ladder, Board, GameState, AudioManager, SaveManager)
- **Custom 3D models** for players and snakes
- **7 sound effects** + background music
- **2 game modes** (vs Computer & Multiplayer)
- **100% Vanilla JavaScript** - No framework dependencies!

### 💡 Key Features:

🎯 Players rotate to face their direction of movement
