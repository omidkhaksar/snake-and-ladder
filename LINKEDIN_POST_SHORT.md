🎲 Just finished building a fully-featured 3D Snake & Ladder game! 

Built with Three.js, this isn't your typical board game. It features:

✨ AI opponent that plays against you
✨ Egyptian-themed 3D graphics with custom models  
✨ Full audio system with music & sound effects
✨ Auto-save functionality (never lose progress!)
✨ Support for 2-7 players
✨ Smart game mechanics (players rotate, dynamic spacing, etc.)

**Tech Stack:** Three.js • JavaScript ES6+ • Web Audio API • LocalStorage • Vite

**6,900+ lines** of modular code across 8 core classes, all in vanilla JavaScript!

🔗 Open source on GitHub: https://github.com/omidkhaksar/snake-and-ladder

Key learning: Building immersive 3D experiences in the browser is more accessible than ever with modern web APIs and Three.js!
